# JavaQAP4

QAP 4 for Advanced Programming in Java

## Problem 1: Abstract Classes

- Make various geometric shape classes with methods to compute perimeter and area
- Design inheritance hierarchy with abstract class
- Check conditions and print error messages if condition not met
- Create a Demo class to test
  - create objects from different classes
  - loop and print object name, area and perimeter utilizint toString

## Problem 2: Interfaces

- Utilize an interface to mimic multiple-inheretance of languages such C++
- refactor code in problem to utilize a interface
- Create Demo class to implement interface

## Problem 3: Exception Handling

- wrap loop block in a try/catch to catch an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception
- add an error message to gracefully handle the exception

## Problem 4: Exception Handling

- Modify provided code to catch a NumberFormatException
